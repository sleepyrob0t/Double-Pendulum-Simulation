# Double-Pendulum-Simulation
Something a made a little while back as a little python project in my free time and decided to import it onto here so others can see it. Feel free to change the code and mess with it. Something I would like to see but didn't have the time to program but maybe which anyone else could do is program it so you can change how fast the pendulum swings or changing the length of each rod.
